# Cstruct
Implementations of various data structures in C. I created these for use in my operating systems class, and have attempted to refine it to give some resemblence to OOP style, trying to utilize concepts from Axel Schreiner's book [Object-oriented Programming in ANSI-C][1], which I've found to be a fascinating read.
